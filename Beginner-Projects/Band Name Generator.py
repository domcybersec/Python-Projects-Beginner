# creating a name generator that takes two inputs (home city and pet name) to create a name for the user

# first is the initial dialogue 
print('Welcome to the Band Name Generator!')

# get the name of the User's City
userPet = input('Oh that\'s nice, what\'s the name of your pet?\n')
# Get the name of the User's pet
# Combine the two with the final dialogue 
print('Hmmm, how about using ' + userCity + ' ' + userPet + ' as your band\'s name?')
